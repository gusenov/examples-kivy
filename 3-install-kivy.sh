# The simplest is to install the current stable version of kivy and optionally kivy_examples from the kivy-team provided PyPi wheels. Simply do:

python -m pip install "kivy[base]" kivy_examples

# https://pypi.org/project/Kivy/
# https://pypi.org/project/Kivy-examples/

# This also installs the minimum dependencies of Kivy. 
# To additionally install Kivy with audio/video support, install either kivy[base,media] or kivy[full]. 
# See Kivyâ€™s dependencies for the list of selectors.
