# Create a new virtual environment for your Kivy project. 
# A virtual environment will prevent possible installation conflicts with other Python versions and packages. 
# Itâ€™s optional but strongly recommended:

# Create the virtual environment named kivy_venv in your current directory:
python -m venv kivy_venv
